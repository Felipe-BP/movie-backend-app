# Movie-Backend-App

## About this Repo

This repository was created to test MovieDB API. The idea is to create an API to consume MovieDB, and over time evolve the features, such as: user management, search for movies, creation of watchlist, details page for a specific movie, with comments and ratings.

The first version of this API was deployed in Heroku --> (https://www.heroku.com/)
